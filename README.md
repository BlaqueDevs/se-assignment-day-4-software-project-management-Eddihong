## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Why is a project schedule important?
A well-planned project schedule ensures that all tasks are completed on time and in the correct sequence. Without proper scheduling, software projects can face delays, resource mismanagement, and budget overruns.

How do Gantt Charts assist in scheduling?
A Gantt Chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing tasks along a timeline. It includes:

Task names (e.g., "Develop Login System").
Start and end dates for each task.
Dependencies (e.g., "Database setup must be completed before API development begins").
For example, if a software project takes 6 months, a Gantt Chart helps identify:
 Which tasks should be completed in the first month.
 How different tasks overlap and depend on each other.
 Which milestones (e.g., Beta Launch) must be achieved.

By using Gantt Charts in tools like Microsoft Project, Trello, or Jira, teams can improve coordination and ensure deadlines are met.
